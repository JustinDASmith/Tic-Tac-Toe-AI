# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, where you can play against an AI opponent that uses a basic heuristic strategy.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the game by executing the following command:

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. You will play as 'X' and take turns against the AI opponent 'O'. Enter your move by typing a number from 0 to 8, corresponding to the board positions as shown below:
5. The game ends when one of the players wins or the board is full (a draw). The winner is displayed at the end of the game.

## AI Strategy

The AI opponent uses a simple heuristic strategy:

1. If there's a winning move for the AI, it will take that move.
2. If there's a winning move for the player, the AI will block it.
3. If none of the above, the AI will choose a random available move.
